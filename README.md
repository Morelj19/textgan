# GAN for Generating Representative Text

Using a dataset which is split into sentences from different authors (e.g. a chat log), the goal of this project is to generate _representative_ text from each individual author. By _representative_ text, we mean text which is distinctively from a particular author. 

## How to Use

## Evaluation
Currently, "representative" is a subjective term, and thus isn't quantitatively evaluated. We evaluate our results using BLEU [^BLEU].
